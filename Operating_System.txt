#PARTS OF AN OPERATING SYSTEM ------------------------------------

##Kernel: Manages computer's hardware resources. Is the core of an operating system. Talks directly to the hardware.
	Does file storage, file management.
	Manages processes using a process scheduler.
	Optimizes memory usage, ensure applications have enough memory to run.
	Manages I/O, which allows us to interact with the computer.

##User Space: Everything outside the kernel. System Programs, User Interfaces. 


#FILE SYSTEMS ----------------------------------------------------

	Three main components to handling files in an OS: File data, metadata, file system. File data is all the actual data belonging to a file, or a file's contents. Metadata is data about the file, like its name, type, etc. The file system is a combination of metadata and procedures that allow files to be stored on a storage device.
	

	Different OSs often use different file systems. Common ones: NTFS, ext4, HFS+. Journaled file systems do a better job of saving data in case of some kind of failure.
	Data is written in blocks, for better utilization of storage space. All of a file's data need not be stored in the same place.
	
#BOOT PROCESS -----------------------------------------------------
 1. BIOS initializes computers hardware, runs POST to make sure everything is good to go.
 2. Depending on BIOS settings, a boot device is selected. Can be hard disk, can be USB device attached to computer. Computer searches for a boot loader in each device in boot order.
 3. Loads bootloader and executes program. The program loads a larger and more complex program, eventually loading kernel.
 4. Kernel loads up drivers to allow hardware and software to talk.
 5. System processes and user space items are launched, like login and desktop environment.
