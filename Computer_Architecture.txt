#Three broad components:----------------------------------

##Hardware: stuff you can touch. 

##Operating System: Software that operates the hardware, provides abstraction for applications

##Software: Applications that use the hardware through the operating system to do stuff we want it to do, like run games, process documents, etc.

##User: Someone who uses software.




#PC Components------------------------------------------------

##Ports: Points we can connect devices to to extend a computer's functionality
	USB: Universal Serial Bus. Common versions: 2.0, 3.0, 3.1. 480Mb/s, 5 Gb/s, 10 Gb/s.
	HDMI: Video and Audio
	Display Port: Audio and Video.

##CPU: Does calculation stuff
###Two major types of CPU sockets:
	LGA: Land Grid Array. Pins stick out of MoBo.
	PGA: Pin Grid Array. Pins on CPU.
###Two architectures:
	32 bit: addressable memory is of 32 bits
	64 bit: addressable memory is of 64 bits. Handles larger amounts of RAM more effectively than a 32 bit system.

##RAM: Short term memory. Used to store data temporarily, eg. programs that are currently executing.
	Randomly accessed. Data can be accessed from any part of this memory, hence faster access times than with HDDs.
### types of RAM:
	DRAM: Dynamic RAM. Stores bits on semiconductors embedded in chip.
	SDRAM: Synchronous DRAM. Synchronized to system clock speed, allowing it to be faster.
	DDR SDRAM: Double Data Rate SDRAM. Often referred to as DDR. Current iteration is DDR4.

##Storage: Stuff like HDDs, SSDs. Holds data permanently. Kinda.
	HDDs: Use a spinning platter and a mechanical arm to read and store data. Speed measured in RPM, revolutions per minute.
	SSDs: Basically USB sticks. Static, so more resistant to damage. More expensive.
###Interfaces:
	ATA:Advanced Technology Attachment.
	SATA: Serial ATA. Machine needn't be turned off to attach SATA drive.
	NVMe: Drive added as an expansion slot.
###Metrics used for storage:
	KB Kilobyte. 1000 bits. MB, GB, TB, PB and so on
	KiB Kibibyte. 1024 bits. MiB, GiB, TiB, PiB and so on.
	

##Mother Board: Holds everything in place, allows above computer components to talk to each other, allows external devices to communicate with computer through ports.
###Chipset: Determines how components talk to each other.
	Northbridge: Connects RAM, Video Cards, etc.
	Southbridge: Maintains IO controllers including hard drives and USB devices.
###Expansion Slots: Gives us the ability to increase computer functionality.
	PCI Express: Peripheral Component Interconnect Express. Standard for expansion slots today.
###Form Factors: MoBo sizes
	ATX: Advanced Technology Extended. A common form factor. Full sized.
	ITX: Information Technology Extended. Smaller than ATX. Sizes are ITX, mini-ITX, pico-ITX.


##Power Supply: Converts energy taken from wall supply to a format the computer can use.
	Can connect low voltage outlet to high voltage device without doing much harm. High voltage outlet to low voltage device might fry device.




#PROGRAMS AND HARDWARE---------------------------------------------

##Programs: instructions that tell a computer what to do

	Parts of programs are stored in RAM for faster access by the CPU

##External data bus: Wires which carry data around the computer. Data is placed in registers through this.

##Registers: High speed memory for CPU to use to store intermediate results

##Memory Controller Chip: Bridge between CPU and RAM. Handles memory accesses on RAM from CPU. Takes memory generated by CPU to retrieve data at that address

##Address Bus: Line connecting CPU to MCC, through which the CPU sends addresses.

##Cache: smaller than RAM. Stores data which is recently or frequently accessed.
	L1 Cache: Cache split into cache for data and for instructions
	L2 Cache: Non-split cache. Dedicated to each core in a CPU
	L3 Cache: Shared between cores.

##CPU has timer, which it is connected to through a wire, called a clock wire. It allows the CPU to keep its operations in sync.

##Clock Cycle: An impulse on the clock wire, which lets CPU perform next step.

##Clock Speed: the number of cycles that CPU can perform in a single unit of time, usually in seconds.

##Overclocking: Increasing CPU cycles to improve performance, with risk of overheating CPU.

##Drivers: Program which makes sense of and operates hardware.

##BIOS: Software that helps initialize hardware. Stored on a ROM chip on the motherboard. Starts computer.
##UEFI: Unified Extensible Firmware Interface. Performs same functions as BIOS, but better.
###CMOS:Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor. A small amount of memory, located on a motherboard, which stores BIOS settings, which may include system time and date as well as hardware settings.
###POST: Power On Self Test. Computers run this test to make sure all hardware is working correctly, and detects what hardware is on the computer. May beep to signal messages, since there is no way to display them on screen as video drivers haven't been loaded yet. 



#BUILDING A PC------------------------------------------------------

 - Buy an anti-static wristband or intermittently touch non painted metallic surface to get rid of static electricity.
 - Keep computer parts in anti static bags until you need to install them.
 - Motherboard has screw holes which coincide with holes in the desktop case.
 - Screw in standoffs. Standoffs raise and attach mobo to case.
 - Add CPU to mobo. Pointer on CPU and mobo should be aligned.
 - Add heat sink on top of CPU. Apply small dab on top of CPU, spread evenly with flat object.
 - Go over screws to make sure everything is secured tightly.
 - Plug cooler to motherboard. CPU controls fan speed via motherboard.
 - Install RAM into RAM slots.
 - Slide storage into storage cage, connect SATA cable to drive and motherboard.
 - more stuff that I can't be bothered to write.
