NETWORKING DEVICES ------------------------------------

Cables - may be copper or fibre
	Copper - common: Cat5, cat5e, cat6(vary voltage)
		cat5e - greater maximum distance than cat6, but less reliable
	Fibre - (vary light)
	
Collision Domain - Network segment where only one device can communicate at a time

Hubs - connects many computers at once
	all devices talk to all other devices connected to a single hub. It's up to the devices to filter out the messages meant for them
	Layer 1 device

Switch - Layer 2 device
	Can inspect protocol data, determine which system the data is intended for, and send it to that system alone
	
Routers - Layer 3 devices
	Device that can forward data between independent devices
	Inspects IP data to decide where to send things
	Core routers - sophisticated routers that ISPs use. Forms the backbone of the Internet. Routers share data with each other using BGP.

Server - Programs or machines whose primary purpose is to provide, or "serve," data to a client.

THE PHYSICAL LAYER-------------------------------

Moves 1s and 0s over a physical link
Line coding - using variations in voltage or any sort of signal to represent 1s and 0s.

Twisted Pairs
	Copper wires twisted together
	Twisting mitigates crosstalk
	
Network Ports, Patch ports
	RJ45 - Registered Jack 45. Plug which exposes wires in twisted pair cables.
	Ports usually have two LEDs, link light and activity light
		Link light - Cable is properly connected to two devices which are both powered on
		Activity light - data is being sent through the port.

DATA LINK LAYER----------------------------------	

Ethernet - Uses the physical layer to send data so that layers above the data link layer need no knowledge of the physical layer.
	CSMA/CD - Listen, if no data being transmitted then send, if collision detected wait for some random interval.
	MAC address(media access control address) - globallly unique identifier attached to an individual network interface 
		48 bit number, 6 groups of 2 hexadecimal digits.
		First 3 octets are organizationally unique identifiers if bit1 of the first octet is 0, else, MAC address is locally administered.
		if bit 0 = 0, unicast, else if bit0=1, multicast
		
	Ethernet frame
		
		Preamble - 8 bytes, where the last byte is the SFD, start frame delimiter
		Destination address
		Source address
		Tag - 4 bytes, VLAN tag, used for making virtual LANs
		Ether type - 2 bytes, used to describe the protocol or the contents of the frame.
		Payload - 46-1500 bytes 
		Frame Check Sequence - 4 bytes, represents checksum for entire frame. Uses cyclical redundancy check. If CRC calculated at receiving end is not equal to CRC transmitted, then some error in transmission occurred


THE NETWORK LAYER-----------------------------------

IP addresses - 32 bit numbers, represented by dotted decimal notation. 4 octets separated by dots, with the decimal value of each octet.
	IP addresses belong to a network, not a device.
	
IPv4 datagrams -  

	key: NameOfSegment(number of bits)
								Total bytes
								-----------
	Version(4) Hlen(4) Service Type(8) Total Length(16)	4
	Identification(16) Flags(3) Fragment Offset(13)		8	
	TTL(8) Protocol(8) Header Checksum(16)			12
	Source(32)						16
	Destination(32)						20
	Options(x) padding(32n - x)				32n + 20
	Payload							0-65535
