#INTRO

##Three broad components:-

###Hardware: stuff you can touch. 

###Operating System: Software that operates the hardware, provides abstraction for applications

###Software: Applications that use the hardware through the operating system to do stuff we want it to do, like run games, process documents, etc.

###User: Someone who uses software.


##PC Components

###Ports: Points we can connect devices to to extend a computer's functionality

###CPU: Does the calculation stuff

###RAM: Short term memory. Used to store data temporarily, eg. programs that are currently executing.
	Randomly accessed. Data can be accessed from any part of this memory, hence faster access times than with HDDs.

###Hard Drive: Storage. Holds data ~permanently.

###Mother Board: Holds everything in place, allows above computer components to talk to each other, allows external devices to communicate with computer through ports.

###Power Supply: Converts energy taken from wall supply to a format the computer can use.


##PROGRAMS AND HARDWARE: 

###Programs: instructions that tell a computer what to do

	Parts of programs are stored in RAM for faster access by the CPU

###External data bus: Wires which carry data around the computer. Data is placed in registers through this.

###Registers: High speed memory for CPU to use to store intermediate results

###Memory Controller Chip: Bridge between CPU and RAM. Handles memory accesses on RAM from CPU. Takes memory generated by CPU to retrieve data at that address

###Address Bus: Line connecting CPU to MCC, through which the CPU sends addresses.

###Cache: smaller than RAM. Stores data which is recently or frequently accessed.
	L1 Cache: Cache split into cache for data and for instructions
	L2 Cache: Non-split cache. Dedicated to each core in a CPU
	L3 Cache: Shared between cores.

###CPU has timer, which it is connected to through a wire, called a clock wire. It allows the CPU to keep its operations in sync.

###Clock Cycle: An impulse on the clock wire, which lets CPU perform next step.

###Clock Speed: the number of cycles that CPU can perform in a single unit of time, usually in seconds.

###Overclocking: Increasing CPU cycles to improve performance, with risk of overheating CPU.
